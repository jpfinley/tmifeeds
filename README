Twits.js is my ghetto-sled widget for including a customizable Twitter feed
on your web-page. It requires Prototype 1.6, available from 
http://prototypejs.org

Without code from the following URLS and their respective authors this script 
would have taken about 3 days instead of 3 hours.

http://twitter.pbwiki.com/RelativeTimeScripts (Mike Demers)

Usage: 

Include the following scripts in your page's header:

<script type="text/javascript" src="prototype-1.6.0.3.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="twits.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="twits.css" type="text/css" media="screen" title="no title" charset="utf-8">

The TwitsOptions hash contains the configuration info for the script:
  user: your twitter username (authentication is not supported, your feed must
  be public)
  
  div: the #ID of an element into which to insert your twitter list
  
  render: a function to render an individual tweet into a UL element. it is 
  assumed but not required that each tweet appears in its own LI element.

You can roll your own twits.css stylesheet to style the tweets as you please.
